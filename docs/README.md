# Introduction

## What is Grids?
  Grids is an easy-to-use easy-to-learn game design programming language based on the use of grids. Through the application of a straightforward and elegant syntax, Grids allows creators to bring their game ideas to life in a quick and simple way.
  
## How did Grids come to be? 
  Grids was born out of our love for video games and simplicity. Anyone who's ever been a kid has, at some point or another, loved a game. Whether it's board games, card games, video games or even conversation games, games are a part everyone's life. With Grids, we hope to provide a tool that anyone can use to expand their game library with only one requirement: their imagination!
  
# About the language

## Features
  Grids is all about bringing forth the most functionality with simplicity. To achieve this and more, the language implements the following:
  
- A simple and elegant syntax, making the commands easy to learn.
- An easy-to-use grid-based design.
- Importing of images into the game to use as object sprites.
- Rules to define game conditions.

## Grids Architecture

1. First and foremost, code is written in Grids. 
2. This code is then passed to the lexer in the grids.py file, where the code is tokenized. 
3. After tokenization is successful the parser comes into play (also located in the grids.py file). The parser makes sure the grammar rules are followed and takes the data from the commands. 
4. That data is used to run the intermediate python code. 
5. The main component of the intermediate code is the controller.py file which brings everything together.
