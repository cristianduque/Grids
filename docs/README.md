## About Grids
  Grids is an easy-to-use easy-to-learn game design programming language based on the use of grids. Through the application of a straightforward and elegant syntax, Grids allows creators to bring their game ideas to life in a quick and simple way. The language accomplishes this by basing all interactions through a "Position-Object Type-Rule" relationship between all game objects.
	Grids was born out of our love for video games and simplicity. Anyone who's ever been a kid has, at some point or another, loved a game. Whether it's board games, card games, video games or even conversation games, games are a part everyone's life. With Grids, we hope to provide a tool that anyone can use to expand their game library with only one requirement: their imagination!
